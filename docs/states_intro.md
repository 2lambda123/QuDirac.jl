This section provides an introduction to working with Bras and Kets, the building blocks of Dirac notation. 

*Note: Throughout this documentation, I'll refer to `ket`s (lowercase) and Kets (uppercase). "Ket" refers to a type, while `ket` refers to the convenience constructor for that type. The same goes for `bra` and "Bra".*
